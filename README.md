# Image Mosaicing

Image mosaicing is the alignment and stitching of a collection of images having overlapping regions into a  single image. In this assignment, we have been given three images which were captured by panning the scene left to right. These images (img1.png, img2.png and img3.png), (img7.png, img8.png and img9.png) capture overlapping regions of the same scene from different viewpoints. The task is to determine the geometric transformations (homographies) between these images and stitch them into a single image.
